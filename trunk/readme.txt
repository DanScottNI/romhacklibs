Requirements
============
This solution has been built using Visual Studio 2008 Professional. The library has one dependency, LinqBridge (which is included in the solution).

Information
===========
ROMClasses is a C# library, which is designed to provide easy to use classes for hacking ROMs. It focuses on the NES, because I have no experience with other systems. It is designed for .NET 2.0. There is a demo project, of which only the Full Render tab currently works. (the rest of the functionality exists, it is just that the demo project itself hasn't been fully written) The library is licensed under the LGPL 3.0. The rest of the solution is public domain, or falls under the licenses of its authors.
